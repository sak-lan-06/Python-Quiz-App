# Python-Quiz-App
This Python project is a simple command-line quiz application. It presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user, one at a time. Each question has a 5-second time limit. The user's score is calculated based on the number of correct answers, and the final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.
